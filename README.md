Modeling climate change effects on Popillia japonica overwintering

We are investing the potential increase in overwinter survival of a destructive pest (Popillia japonica) of turf, landscape, and ornamental plants in Minnesota.

This involves extracting remotely sensed datat (ERA-5 climatic reanalysis data) from Google Earth Engine and modeling in R.
